## ☕ More about 
Spicers is a store of spicy products. At the moment, the project is made of 5 pages and all of them has good features:
  * **Home**: See and add products (set amount wanted, see availability of item); 
  * **About**: See infos about store
  * **Contact**: See contact infos and send a message
  * **Cart**: See added products and total shop value; Re-set amount wanted 
  * **Login**: Login or create an account;
<br>
Besides that, obviously the project is 100% adaptable for mobile devices and strategy planned for future software maintenance.

_*PS:* The Render (deployment platoform) non paid deploy desacelerates the API after 15 minutes inactivity. So probably, you'll have to wait some time to test it. To overcome this, you can just clone the frontend and backend repos and test in your device._
